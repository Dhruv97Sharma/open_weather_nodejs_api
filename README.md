# Nodejs Openweathermap public API

#### First nodejs api project setting up using the open weather map public api https://openweathermap.org/api

#### Learned through following nodejs api creation taught by brad traversy @bradtraversy.
### video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGymN8aFsv4

### Learned the following concepts:

- Creating simple nodejs proxy server using third party api
- structuring the routes for a nodejs api
- implementing caching and cache time expiry limits in the api data
- implementing rate limits for the proxy api
- setting up api keys and values securely in an environment variable


### Still to improve and to do (future scope):

- Deploy the proxy server
- package the proxy api as an aws lambda function and use it for testing
- consume the api in a front-end app
